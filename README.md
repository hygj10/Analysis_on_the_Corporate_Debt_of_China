# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Hoyoung Jun in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.
In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing
thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text
and the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.
